## Credits for basic source
This repository depends on https://ko-fi.com/s/0ca8fe898a<br>
It was made for alt:V Server 4.0-rc1 (rc) but it is discontinued.

I changed the following:<br>
- fix native arguments
- fix collision on vehicle load to towtruck
- fix collision after release from towtruck
- cleared code from wired comments

I updated it for the latest Version from alt:V 7.3<br><br>
Please let Poiivre a bit love there. Thanks 💖
